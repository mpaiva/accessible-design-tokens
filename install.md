# Implementing Accessible Design Tokens
Welcome to the installation guide for integrating Accessible Design Tokens into your design system. This page provides comprehensive instructions and examples on how to implement our JSON-based design tokens using different CSS methodologies, including PostCSS and CSS-in-JS frameworks. By following these examples, developers can enhance the accessibility and usability of their digital products, ensuring they comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and offer a more inclusive user experience. Whether you are updating an existing design system or building a new one, these guidelines will help you seamlessly integrate essential accessibility features into your project.


## CSS-in-JS – Implementing Design Tokens in Your Design System

To integrate the provided design tokens into your existing design system, follow these steps to ensure your interfaces are both compliant with accessibility standards and practically enhanced for user interaction. This standardized approach ensures that your digital products are accessible and consistent.

### Steps for Implementation
1. **Evaluate Existing Components**: Review your current design system components and identify where these design tokens can replace or enhance existing styles.
2. **Incorporate Tokens**: Implement the design tokens into your system’s style definitions. This can be done by including the JSON file directly into your project or by converting the tokens into variables in your CSS or preprocessor files.
3. **Apply Tokens**: Use these tokens consistently across all components. For instance, apply minimum size tokens to all button components, color contrast tokens to all text elements, and focus indicators to all interactive elements.
4. **Test for Compliance**: Use accessibility testing tools and manual testing to ensure that changes meet WCAG standards and improve the user experience across various disabilities.
5. **Iterate and Refine**: Based on testing feedback and user input, refine the token values and their applications. This iterative approach helps in fine-tuning your design system to meet diverse user needs effectively.

### Example: Implementing the JSON Schema
To implement the JSON schema in your design system, you might first include it in your project as a configuration file. Here’s a basic example of how you can import this JSON into a CSS or Sass environment and use it to set styles dynamically:

```javascript
// Import design tokens JSON file
const designTokens = require('./path/to/designTokens.json');

// Example function to apply a token value
function applyToken(tokenName) {
  return designTokens.category.token-sets.tokens.find(token => token.token-name === tokenName).value;
}

// Usage in CSS-in-JS
const Button = styled.button`
  min-width: ${applyToken('minimumButtonSize')};
  min-height: ${applyToken('minimumButtonSize')};
  background-color: ${applyToken('primaryColor')};
  color: ${applyToken('textColor')};
  border-radius: ${applyToken('focusBorderRadius')};
  border: ${applyToken('focusBorderWidth')} solid ${applyToken('focusBorderColor')};
`;
```

## PostCSS – Implementing Design Tokens in Your Design System

To integrate the provided design tokens into your existing design system, follow these steps to ensure your interfaces are both compliant with accessibility standards and practically enhanced for user interaction. This standardized approach ensures that your digital products are accessible and consistent.

### Steps for Implementation
1. **Evaluate Existing Components**: Review your current design system components and identify where these design tokens can replace or enhance existing styles.
2. **Incorporate Tokens**: Implement the design tokens into your system’s style definitions. This can be done by including the JSON file directly into your project or by converting the tokens into variables in your CSS or preprocessor files.
3. **Apply Tokens**: Use these tokens consistently across all components. For instance, apply minimum size tokens to all button components, color contrast tokens to all text elements, and focus indicators to all interactive elements.
4. **Test for Compliance**: Use accessibility testing tools and manual testing to ensure that changes meet WCAG standards and improve the user experience across various disabilities.
5. **Iterate and Refine**: Based on testing feedback and user input, refine the token values and their applications. This iterative approach helps in fine-tuning your design system to meet diverse user needs effectively.

### Example: Implementing the JSON Schema with PostCSS
To implement the JSON schema in your design system using PostCSS, you can use PostCSS variables or a plugin like `postcss-import-json` to convert JSON tokens into CSS custom properties:

```css
/* Import design tokens JSON file as CSS variables */
@import-json 'path/to/accessibleDesignTokens.json' {
  transform: (value, name) => `--${name}: ${value};`
};

/* Apply these variables within your CSS */
.button {
  min-width: var(--minimumButtonSize);
  min-height: var(--minimumButtonSize);
  background-color: var(--primaryColor);
  color: var(--textColor);
  border-radius: var(--focusBorderRadius);
  border: var(--focusBorderWidth) solid var(--focusBorderColor);
}
