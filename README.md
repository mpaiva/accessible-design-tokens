# Accessible Design Tokens
Explore a curated collection of design tokens designed to meet WCAG standards, aiding design systems in maintaining accessibility across size, spacing, color, typography, and timing. This repository provides guidelines, examples, and best practices to help designers and developers implement these tokens into their design systems, ensuring consistent and accessible digital interfaces.

## About this community
Our mission is to enhance digital accessibility by providing a robust and standardized set of design tokens aligned with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We empower designers and developers to seamlessly integrate these tokens into existing design systems, ensuring that digital products are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Creating WCAG Design Tokens
Our initiative focuses on creating design tokens that can be used in design systems to meet different WCAG success criteria. It focuses on key areas like size, spacing, color, typography, and timing. This provides a clear method for designers and developers to make sure all digital content follows accessibility standards. These tokens act as helpful tools that allow design teams to consistently apply accessibility throughout their projects, ensuring their work is inclusive and meets global accessibility guidelines.

Below is a comprehensive list of the key WCAG criteria that our design tokens will address:

### Size and Spacing
- **1.4.12 Text Spacing**
  - Modify text spacing (line height, paragraph spacing, letter spacing, word spacing) without loss of content or functionality.

### Colors
- **1.4.1 Use of Color**
  - Color is not the sole means of conveying information, initiating action, or distinguishing a visual element.
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)**
  - Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
- **1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)**
  - Higher contrast ratio of 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
- **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast**
  - Visual presentation of UI components and graphical objects must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

### Typography
- **1.4.4 Resize Text**
  - Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
- **1.4.8 Visual Presentation**
  - Control over foreground and background color, width of text blocks, and line spacing.

### Timing Units
- **2.2.1 Timing Adjustable**
  - Ability to turn off, adjust, or extend time limits unless required by the content.
- **2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide**
  - Control over moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information.

### Target Size
- **2.5.5 Target Size (Minimum)**
  - Target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels, except under certain conditions.

### Additional Interaction and Layout
- **1.4.10 Reflow**
  - Content can reflow without loss of information or functionality, not requiring scrolling in two dimensions at specific dimensions.
- **1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus**
  - Additional content triggered by hover or keyboard focus is dismissible, hoverable, and persistent.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible**
  - Keyboard focus indicator must be visible.
- **2.5.3 Label in Name**
  - Text labels must match the visual presentation for interactive elements.

## Next Steps and Contributing to the Repository

### What's Next?
As we continue to refine and expand our repository, we aim to keep improving the design tokens to ensure they not only meet current WCAG guidelines but also anticipate future accessibility needs. Our next steps include:

- **Updating Tokens Regularly**: We will keep the tokens up-to-date with the latest accessibility standards and design trends.
- **Expanding Token Categories**: Plans are in place to introduce additional tokens that cover more aspects of accessibility, such as auditory and cognitive dimensions.
- **Enhancing Documentation**: We will provide more detailed documentation and examples to make the integration process as straightforward as possible.
