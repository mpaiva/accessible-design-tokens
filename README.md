# Accessible Design Tokens
Explore a curated collection of design tokens designed to meet WCAG standards, aiding design systems in maintaining accessibility across size, spacing, color, typography, and timing. This repository provides guidelines, examples, and best practices to help designers and developers implement these tokens into their design systems, ensuring consistent and accessible digital interfaces.

## Goals of the Accessible Design Tokens Repository

The primary goal of the "Accessible Design Tokens" repository is to provide a comprehensive and standardized set of design tokens that align with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These tokens are crafted to facilitate the integration of accessibility into existing design systems efficiently and effectively. By utilizing this repository, designers and developers can achieve several key objectives:

1. **Enhance Accessibility**: Ensure that digital products are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The tokens help address crucial accessibility issues related to visual and interactive elements.
2. **Promote Consistency**: Aid in maintaining a consistent approach to accessibility across different parts of a product or service. By implementing these standardized tokens, teams can ensure that accessibility considerations are uniformly applied throughout.
3. **Ease of Integration**: Provide a ready-to-use resource that can be seamlessly incorporated into existing design systems. The tokens are designed to be adaptable and can be customized to meet specific design requirements while adhering to accessibility standards.
4. **Educate and Guide**: Serve as an educational tool for designers and developers new to accessibility, offering clear guidelines, examples, and best practices. This repository aims to raise awareness and understanding of accessibility principles and how they can be implemented in everyday design work.
5. **Support Compliance**: Assist in meeting legal and regulatory requirements for accessibility. As many regions enforce compliance with standards like WCAG, using these design tokens can help organizations meet these obligations and avoid potential legal issues.
6. **Foster Community Contribution**: Encourage the design and development community to contribute to the ongoing refinement and expansion of the design tokens. Open collaboration will help keep the tokens up-to-date with the latest accessibility standards and best practices.


## WCAG Success Criteria Supported by Design Tokens
This section explains how design tokens can be used in design systems to meet different WCAG success criteria. It focuses on key areas like size, spacing, color, typography, and timing. This provides a clear method for designers and developers to make sure all digital content follows accessibility standards. These tokens act as helpful tools that allow design teams to consistently apply accessibility throughout their projects, ensuring their work is inclusive and meets global accessibility guidelines.

  - Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
- **1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)**
  - Higher contrast ratio of 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
- **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast**
  - Visual presentation of UI components and graphical objects must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

### Typography
- **1.4.4 Resize Text**
  - Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
- **1.4.8 Visual Presentation**
  - Control over foreground and background color, width of text blocks, and line spacing.

### Timing Units
- **2.2.1 Timing Adjustable**
  - Ability to turn off, adjust, or extend time limits unless required by the content.
- **2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide**
  - Control over moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information.

### Target Size
- **2.5.5 Target Size (Minimum)**
  - Target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels, except under certain conditions.

### Additional Interaction and Layout
- **1.4.10 Reflow**
  - Content can reflow without loss of information or functionality, not requiring scrolling in two dimensions at specific dimensions.
- **1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus**
  - Additional content triggered by hover or keyboard focus is dismissible, hoverable, and persistent.
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible**
  - Keyboard focus indicator must be visible.
- **2.5.3 Label in Name**
  - Text labels must match the visual presentation for interactive elements.
 
## Accessible Design Tokens Example
The JSON file presented below offers an example of a collection of design tokens designed to align with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These tokens encapsulate the best practices as per WCAG 2.5.5, ensuring that elements such as buttons, links, and custom controls have a minimum size of 44x44 pixels:

### Target Size (Minimum)
Design tokens that establish minimum target sizes for interactive elements, thereby enhancing usability and accessibility for all users.
```json
{
  "category": {
    "category-name": "Target Size",
    "category-description": "Design tokens to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.5.5, specifying minimum target sizes for interactive elements to promote better interaction.",

        "wcag-level": "AA",
        "user-benefit": "By specifying a minimum target size, these tokens help ensure that all users, especially those with limited dexterity, can interact with elements more easily and with less likelihood of error.",
        "tokens": [
          {"token-name": "minimumButtonSize", "value": "44px"},
          {"token-name": "minimumIconSize", "value": "44px"},
          {"token-name": "minimumCustomControlSize", "value": "44px"}
        ]
      }
